# Bill_Oberkirsch this is my portfolio page

Just completed the banner section of the page, and in name and image.
Put rounded curves around the image and gave it a border
Project not completed, had/have issue with resizing the images.  the images are way to big needed to find a way to shrink them. was able to use gimp to shrink  the  first primary one put could not get the others to shrink with out distorting them.  Problems I ran into was getting the divs to format the way I wanted them too and to get the banner to work correctly.  spent more then 30+ hours trying to lay out the basic web page (previous project was summited early to give me more time on this) and that is way too much time for a simple lay out.
